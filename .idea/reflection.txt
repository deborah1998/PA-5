This programming assignment  was extremley difficult for me to understand this week.What I  had most trouble with this week was the error checking part of the programming
assignment especially when it came to the while loop we were supposed to incorportate to determine if the user wanted to continue to find out more about
earthquakes.I found this especially difficult considering we had to have a menu function in our code and somehow take that into consideration when
it came to writing the for loop.I additionally had many problems with the calculation functions as I  kept getting a type error in my code as I tried
to convert the entire equation to a float value or when I tried converting certain aspects of the earthquakes list to an integer. I also had problems
with getting my program to write toa file although i think i set up a pretty good and standard file format and incoroprated it into the earthquake date function.
