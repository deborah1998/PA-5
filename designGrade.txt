PA5 Design Grading
Grade: 8.1/10

[1/1]Properly reads from any file of the given format, with the name given by the user, and stores in a list

[0.5/1]Incorporates all expected error checking (file, user input)
* Missing error checking on values of user input (lat, lon, distance, date)

[1.9/2]Outputs to a file all earthquakes from a specific date
* need better formatted file output
* be careful about comparing dates
* user chooses file name

[1.95/2]Finds and outputs average magnitude
* is magnitude an integer?

[1/2]Determines number of earthquakes within a specific distance of a location
* need user to input distance
* need to compare distances to determine if the distance is within the one given by the user and increase count
* are any of these values actually integers?

[0.75/1]Functions make sense
* user input should never be in a calculation function. Instead pass it as a parameter.

[0.9/1] User has a menu that lets them also keep going until they choose to quit
* need to design loop so the code runs again based on their choice.
