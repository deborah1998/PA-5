Function Name:read_in_file
Purpose:read in a file from the user and return it once they give one that exists
Parameters:None
Return:filename
Algorithm:

1.)Ask the user to input a file
2.)while the file does not exist:
    a.)ask the user to input a file
3.)return filename


Function Name:read_file
Purpose:read from the file
Parameters:filename
Return:earthquakes list
Algorithm:
1.)try
2.)Open the input file from the user.
3.)create an empty list and store it in the variable earthquakes
5.)for every line in the input  file:
    a.)strip every element in line  and then  split every element in the line at the comma, store these elements in the variable list
    b.)append the elements stored in the variable list to the empty list earthquakes
6.)close the input file
7.)except an error
    a.)output "Sorry File Not Found"
8.)return the earthquakes list



Function Name:find_earthquakes_on_date
Purpose: find and output to a file all earthquakes that occured on a specific date
Parameters:the list earthquakes,outfilename
Return:none
Algorithm:

1.)Open the output file
2.)Ask the user to input a specific date to find all earthquakes for, store result in variable earthquake _date
3.)for i in range of the length of earthquakes:
    a.)if earthquake_date equals earthquake[0](the first element in the list being the date)
          i)print earthquake[0:9](everything from the first to last element of list)
4.)close the output file



Function Name:average_magnitude
Purpose:find the average of the earthquakes in the file
Paramaters: the list earthquakes, outfilename
Return:average magnitude of earthquakes in file
Algorithm:
1.)Open the output file that the user names
2.)Set a  variable named  total  equal to zero
3.)Set the count equal to zero
4.)For i in range of the length of earthquakes:
    a.set total equal to the total plus earthquakes[i][4]
    b.add one to count
5.)divide total by count and store the result in the variable average
6.)print the average to the output file
7.)return average
8.)close the output file



Function Name:num_of_earthquakes_in_distance
Purpose:To find the number of earthquakes within a specific distance of a specific location
Paramaters: the list earthquakes,outfilename
Return:
Algorithm:
1.)Open the output file that the user names
2.)Ask the user to input a latitude a store answer in the variable lat1
3.)Ask the user to input a longitude and store answer in the variable lon1
4.)For i in range of length of earthquakes:
    a.perform the calculation arcos(sin(lat1)*sin(int(earthquakes[1])) + cos(lat1) * cos(earthquakes[1]) * cos(lon1 - earthquakes[2])) * 6371
    *typecast list values to integers
5.)





P1=(lat1, lon1) and P2=(lat2, lon2) can be calculated using the formula distance
  = arccos(sin(lat1) * sin(lat2) + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * cos(lon1 - lon2)) * 6371











Function Name:main
Purpose:run the overall program
Paramaters:none
Return:none
Algorithm:
1.)Output the purpose of the program to the user
2.)Call the read from file function
3.)Ask the user to to enter a name for the outputfile answer in variable outputfile
4.)
5.)
