Function Name:read_in_file
Purpose:read in a file from the user and return it once they give one that exists
Parameters:None
Return:filename
Algorithm:

1.)Ask the user to input a file
2.)while the file does not exist:
    a.)ask the user to input a file
3.)return filename


Function Name:read_file
Purpose:read from the file
Parameters:filename
Return:earthquakes list
Algorithm:
1.)try
2.)Open the input file from the user.
3.)create an empty list and store it in the variable earthquakes
5.)for every line in the input  file:
    a.)strip everey element in line  and then  split every element in the line at the comma, store these elements in the variable list
    b.)append the elements stored in the variable list to the empty list earthquakes
6.)close the input file
7.)except an error
    a.)output "Sorry File Not Found"
8.)return the earthquakes list



Function Name:average_magnitude
Purpose:find the average of the earthquakes in the file
Paramaters: the list earhquakes earthquakes
Return:average magnitude of earthquakes in file
Algorithm:
1.)Open the output file that the user names
2.)Set a  variable named  total  equal to zero
3.)Set the count equal to zero
4.)For i in range of the length of earthquakes
    a.set total equal to the total plus earthquakes[i][4]
    b.add one to count
5.)divide total by count and store the result in the variable average
6.)print the average to the output file
7.)return average
8.)close the output file



Function Name:num_of_earthquakes_in_distance
Purpo








    * Output to the user the average magnitude of the earthquakes in the file
* Output to the user the number of earthquakes within
 a specific distance of a specific location. Distance is given by user as kilometers,
 and location is given by user as a latitude and longitude. You must calculate a distance between 2 points based on latitude and longitude.
  The shortest distance between two given points P1=(lat1, lon1) and P2=(lat2, lon2) can be calculated using the formula distance
  = arccos(sin(lat1) * sin(lat2) + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * cos(lon1 - lon2)) * 6371. Note that one of these points comes from the file,
  and one of these points comes from the user, and if you just copy/paste this equation into Python it WILL NOT work.
  See requirements below about programming.
