CS201 Programming Assignment 5 checklist & grading sheet
PA Grade = 37.25 / 50

Comments:
2/2 Intro comments complete and clear
0.25/1 Appropriate in-line commentary given - need in your larger functions, especially main
2/2 Function comments provided for every function

Format:
1/1 Proper use of upper/lowercase
1/1 Appropriate use of whitespace

Supporting Documents:
2/3 Test cases on test file - the point of a test file is so that you can calculate the answers. need to put actual answers in test cases for the test cases to help you test your code.
0/2 Reflection

Correctness/Completeness Issues:
2/2 User provides input and output file name, with error checking on input name
2/2 User provides date, distance, latitude, longitude
1/2 All inputs are error checked as appropriate - date and distance are not error checked
2/2 Reads from the file correctly
2/2 Stores data from file in a list of lists correctly
2/3 Calculates the average magnitude of all earthquakes - crashes because magnitudes are floats, not ints.
Also, can't calculate average until you have everything added together.
3/4 Calculates the number of earthquakes within a specific distance - need to look at earthquake[i][1] and earthquake[i][2] to get the latitude and longitudes. Need to cast to floats. Need to turn everything to radians before using trig functions.
2/4 Saves to a file all earthquakes that occurred on a specific date - output file is empty because slice is wrong (should be 0:10), and comparison is not quite right.
Need to compare the earthquake at index i's first index's first 10 values.
Output file is closed after the first earthquake is compared. Can't close file until you're done writing.
2/3 Provides a menu, which continues until the user chooses to stop - menu doesn't loop
2/2 outputs results
1/1 No other logic errors

Design Issues:
1/1 Appropriate variable names
2/2 Clear prompts
3/3 Clear and well formatted output
4/5 Appropriate function design - user input should not happen in a calculation function. Pass values to calculation function via parameters.

Extra Credit: an additional question (more points for more interesting questions)

Additional Comments:
-2 code crashes on every option
